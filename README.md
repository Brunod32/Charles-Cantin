# Charles Cantin portfolio project

<https://charlescantinphotographe.netlify.app/index.html>

Training evaluation during training: Developing the front-end part of a web application.

Charles Cantin, someone you know, is passionate about photography.
Even if he practices as an amateur, his talent is recognized and many call on him to immortalize their events.
To move up a gear and perhaps make a living from this activity, he wants to be able to build a portfolio in the form of a website.
And since he learned that you were currently in training to become a developer, he calls on you.
